> Are you a shopaholic?
> Visit http://smartstore.owaspctf17.pro/ and shop some flags.
> Hint 1: Try looking for main.go

**Goal:** 

Grabbing our flag via usage of a web vulnerability (or maybe some more, who knows?) within the application, while sticking to provided hits.

## Looking for a new TV

Let's go and access the web application via "http://smartstore.owaspctf17.pro". Looks like a normal shopping website that has some decent products to offer, but does it offer any flags?! we shall see.

Wandering around the website and checking some features lead us to "Products" page, that contains every product that is available on the website, well most of it :)
On each product we have two available functions: "View Product", and "Download PDF". So let's ignite our proxy interceptor and test each one of these functions.

Starting off with "Download PDF" on our desired TV, revealed us some interesting endpoint.

As we can already identify, a GET request is being sent to "/downloadFile" endpoint with a very interesting parameter, which is `file`, and it actually specifies a file that is stored on the webserver. Usually applications should validate user input, so when a page receives the given input to an unauthorized desired path, a directory traversal attack will not execute as of removing `..`, `../`, `.././`. 

Our first hint was to try and look for "main.go" file that is probablly located somewhere on the server, so let's do it.
We will try some traditional directory traversal patterns, adding `../` just before "main.go" in order to go back one folder.

Checking the presented response it looks like we are on the same folder ("downloads"), so it seems that there is some user input validation here, lets try and bypass it with encoded traversal strings.

Vwalla! we got 200 OK sent back from the server, following "main.go" source code as promised. Now we must analyze and understand this piece of code, so we can seek for major flaws.

## Analysing the main piece of code

We will go step by step on each relevant piece of code in order to seek our flaws, and get to know the application better.

```
var (
	RESOURCE_SERVER = "http://127.0.0.1"
	DOWNLOAD_DIRECTORY = "./downloads/"
	ILLEGAL_CHARS = []string {
		"../",
		"<!--",
		"-->",
		"<",
		">",
		"'",
		"\"",
		"&",
		"$",
		"#",
		"{", "}", "[", "]", "=",
		";", "?", "%20", "%22",
		"%3c",   // <
		"%253c", // <
		"%3e",   // >
		"",   // > -- fill in with % 0 e - without spaces in between
		"%28",   // (
		"%29",   // )
		"%2528", // (
		"%26",   // &
		"%24",   // $
		"%3f",   // ?
		"%3b",   // ;
		"%3d",   // =
	}
	CALCULATION_SERVER = "http://10.0.0.185:8080/calc"
)
```

We can see that there are some interesting declarations of global variables, which are used within the application. What are they?

`RESOURCE_SERVER` - stores the localhost address.
`CALCULATION_SERVER` - stores an **internal** URL for a calculation service.
